## :mag_right: Problem Statement
**Modern game controllers do not accommodate for one-handed users.**

After a stroke or injury, a person may lose some function in their body. Recreational products for the public are often made with the assumption that a person has full control of their body, which means that after permanent injuries, a person may become limited in their choice of hobbies.

Our codesigner, Susan Bibbins, suffers from chronic pain from fibromyalgia and has limited function in her right hand. She always wanted to play video games; however, modern controllers do not accomodate one-handed users.

Our team aims to develop a comfortable and accessible game controller designed specifically for one-handed users so that our codesigner can finally play video games that she has always wanted to try.
